## Employee Tracker

The Employee tracker demonstrates my ability to create a functioning command-line application using Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL. 

## Description
* At start of application user is prompted with at least the following: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.
* "View all" commands prompt table associated with command
* "Add"/"Update"/"Delete" prompts user for associated answer then carries out request.
